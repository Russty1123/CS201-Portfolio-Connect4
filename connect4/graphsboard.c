/* I'm Russell McKenzie, and this is my Connect 4 Program for UA's CS201. 
 *
 * This program prompts for a number of players (1-2), turn order, and size of
 * a Connect 4 board. It then proceeds to print to the command line a representation
 * of the board, and prompts the user(s) for moves based on the displayed columns.
 * If there is only 1 player, then a computer will make moves based on a Depth
 * First algorithm to determine a value outlined in code and play the move with
 * the highest perceived value. This computer is a strong player, but was not
 * designed to be unbeatable, particularly because it cannot evaluate the move
 * that he unlocks for the other player above the move it is making.
 *
 * Any and all options may be changed mid-session, but during the time that the
 * program is active, it will keep score based on whether the player going first
 * or second won, awarding no score to a draw. This count will reset with the program,
 * and will not track if players decide to switch their turn order.
